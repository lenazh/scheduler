# Automated GSI scheduling project
### The idea

The purpose of the project is to make the lives of Graduate Student Instructors/Teaching Assistants easier.
Rather that gather everyone on a meeting, ask who can teach which sections, and then match GSIs with the preferences manually, you can get through the process faster with this webapp.
Once the class schedule is created and everyone chose which sections they can teach, the webapp provides a way to automatically assign the sections.
You can either choose from the suggested options, or assign the GSIs manually, in which case the webapp will keep track of how many sections you can assign to any given person and monitor the overall "happiness".

The app is still in development, so if you need help, find any bugs or you can think of a helpful feature, please shoot me an email: lena.zhivun at berkeley.edu (or stop by Birge 275)

### How to use

  - Create a class schedule
  - Enroll the GSIs to find out which sections each one of them prefers
  - Find every possible way of assigning sections in a few clicks
