# Automated GSI scheduling project
### The idea

The purpose of the project is to make the lives of graduate student instructors/teaching assistants easier.
Once the class schedule is created and everyone chose which sections they can teach, the webapp provides a way to automatically match the sections with people who would like to teach them the most.

The app is still in development, so I would appreciate any suggestions and bug reports.

### How to use

  - Create a class schedule
  - Enroll the GSIs to find out which sections each one of them prefers
  - Find every possible way of assigning sections in a few clicks
